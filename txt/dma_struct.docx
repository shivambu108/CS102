/*
Description:
This program uses a structure to represent a book, which includes the title, author, and publication year. The program prompts 
the user to specify the number of books they want to manage. It then dynamically allocates memory for the specified number of books. 
The user is then asked to enter the title, author, and publication year for each book. After all the information is entered, the program
prints out the details of each book. Finally, the program frees the allocated memory before it ends.
*/


/*
Write a C program that dynamically allocates memory for a structure representing a book. 
The structure should have members for the title, author, and publication year. Prompt the user to enter the number of book_ptr.
The program should be able to read the information about the specified number of book_ptr and print the information for a book 
and display it before freeing the allocated memory.
